# Transfer-Learning-with-PyTorch-for-image-classification

In this project, my goal was to develop and train a deep neural network model using PyTorch deep learning library to classify images of bees and ants. I used a small dataset of images of bees and ants that I downloaded from Kaggle datasets. I preprocessed the data so it can be using with deep learning models. The dataset contains around 240 images for training and 150 images for validation and testing, which is too small to train a new deep learning model from scratch. So I used a pretrained deep neural network model ResNet18 from PyToch vision library. ResNet18 model was trained on ImageNet dataset that contains millions of images distributed among thousands of categories. I replaced the output layer of ResNet18 and added a new layer that is suitable for a binary classification problem. I then retrained the modified ResNet18 model on the small dataset of bees and ants. This approach is called transfer learning, and it is quite popular and powerfull approach when we do not have large amount of data to train deep neural network models from scratch. The modified model showed very high accuracy even after retraining on the small dataset. So in this case, the transfer learning was quite successful.
This project was based on "Transfer Learning for Computer Vision Tutorial" by Sasank Chilamkurthy, and "PyTorch Pocket Reference: Building and Deploying Deep Learning Models" by Joe Papa.
